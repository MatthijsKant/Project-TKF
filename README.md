# Project-TKF
This project was composed to provide a detailed overview of the telecommunication division of the Twentsche Kabelfabriek, also referred to as TKF. The aim of this project is to analyze the company’s contingencies and their relationship its organizational effectiveness. Practical information about the company was collected through an interview with a representative along with a company visit; a tour of the factory and a presentation from Wim Bank, the Director of TKF. This data is compared to applicable theoretical information, gathered from textbooks and other relevant sources, in order to identify similarities and differences. This comparison allows an evaluation and justification of the Twentsche Kabelfabriek’s effectiveness in terms of environment, size, structure, strategy and technology. The central question this project focuses on is the fit between the applicable theoretical contingencies and the company’s practical structure.
